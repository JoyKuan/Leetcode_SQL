# LeetCode SQL Progress Tracker

This repository tracks my progress in solving SQL problems on LeetCode. The aim is to enhance SQL query skills and document solutions, insights, and learning.

## 📚 Notes and Concepts Learned

### General SQL Concepts
- **Joins**: Inner join, left join, right join, full join.
- **Aggregation**: `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`.
- **Window Functions**: `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `NTILE()`.
- **Subqueries**: Scalar, correlated, and nested subqueries.

### Common Patterns
- Ranking salaries or scores with `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`.
- Using `GROUP BY` for aggregation.
- Filtering data with `HAVING` after aggregation.
